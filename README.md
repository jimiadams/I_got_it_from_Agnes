# I got it from Agnes

Years ago, I created what likely is the most ridiculous example of a network visualization I've ever put together. It's the network of implied network diffusion from Tom Lehrer's song "I got it from Agnes":

I will not admit how long it took me to get the timing on this down. I made it using an old version of [Skye Bender-deMoll](http://skyeome.net)'s [rSonia](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v024i07) package, then later visualized it with [ndtv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ndtv/index.html).

I've included the .son version of the file (with time stamps), which I believe is importable into a NetworkDynamic object in R and therefore plotable with ndtv. If not, all the information is there to recreate this yourself. I've also attached a version with slightly more information encoded as a Pajek (.net) file with object classes as a .clu file.
